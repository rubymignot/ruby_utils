# ruby_utils
I made cool utilities shaders, script and addons for both Blender and Unity.

You will find :
- Sync Render Visibility : Synchronise Render Visiblity in Blender with Viewport Visibility
- Apply Modifiers : Will apply every single modifier in your scene
- TileBreaker : Unity Shader that does exactly what its name implies

Code isn't great but it works teehee

MIT license do whatever you want with it :)
